## What's fullstackhero's .NET Web API Boilerplate?

fullstackhero's .NET Web API Boilerplate is a starting point for your next `.NET 7 Clean Architecture Project` that incorporates the most essential packages and features your projects will ever need including out of the box Multi-Tenancy support. This project can save well over `200+ hours` of development time for your team.

> As the name suggests, this is an API / Server Boilerplate. You can find other Client Boilerplates that consume this API under `@fullstackhero` handle.
> - Find `Blazor WebAssembly Boilerplate` here - https://github.com/fullstackhero/blazor-wasm-boilerplate

> Feel free to contribute to the Documentation Repository - https://github.com/fullstackhero/docs

## Getting Started

To get started with this Boilerplate, here are the available options.

- Install using the `FSH CLI` tool. Use this for release versions of the Boilerplate only.
- Fork the Repository. Use this if you want to always keep your version of the Boilerplate up-to date with the latest changes.

> Make sure that your DEV enviroment is setup, [Read the Development Environment Guide](https://fullstackhero.net/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/development-environment/)

### FSH CLI Tool

#### Prerequisites

Before creating your first fullstackhero solution, you should ensure that your local machine has:

- **.NET 7** You can find the download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).
- **NodeJS (16+)** You can find the download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

#### Installation

After you have installed .NET, you will need to install the `fsh` console tool.

```bash
dotnet tool install --global FSH.CLI
fsh install
```

This isntall the FSH CLI tools and the associated Templates. You are now ready to create your first FSH project!

#### FSH .NET WebAPI Boilerplate
Here's how you would create a Solution using the FSH .NET WebAPI Boilerplate.

Simply navigate to a new directory (wherever you want to place your new solution), and open up Command Prompt at the opened directory.

Run the following command. Note that, in this demonstration, I am naming my new solution as FSH.Starter.

```bash
fsh api new FSH.Starter
```

OR

```bash
fsh api n FSH.Starter
```

This will create a new .NET 7 WEBAPI solution for you using the FSH Templates.
For further steps and details, [Read the Getting Started Guide](https://fullstackhero.net/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate/general/getting-started/)

#### Update
To update the tool & templates, run the following commands
```bash
dotnet tool update FSH.CLI --global
fsh update
```
### Forking the Repository

You would probably need to take this approach if you want to keep your source code upto date with the latest changes. To get started based on this repository, you need to get a copy locally. You have three options: fork, clone, or download.

- Make a fork of this repository in your Github account.
- Create your new `dotnet-webapi-boilerplate` personal project by cloning the forked repository on your personal github.
- Setup an upstream remote on your personal project pointing to your forked repository using command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/{githubuseraccount}/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate` and `git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE`
